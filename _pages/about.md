I received my Master’s degree in electrical engineering from the Faculty of Electrical engineering, University of Ljubljana. I am currently pursuing my PhD at the same faculty and am working as a researcher at the Department of Communication Systems, Jožef Stefan Institute. Most of my work is done on using dimensionality expansion for classification of motifs in time series data. Lately i am also working on using graph neural networks on time series data with the purpose of motif recognition.

During my work i come across many different blog posts from different researchers, engineers and enthusiasts, which help me understand certain concepts and give some ideas for my work. I started this blog to not only take from the community but also give something back.
